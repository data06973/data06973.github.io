				"One of the most rewarding moments in my data science journey came during a project where I had to apply dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover hidden patterns in a large dataset. Initially, I struggled to understand how methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) could reduce features without losing essential information. The math felt abstract, and interpreting the output was even harder.",
				"But after experimenting with visualizations and reading case studies, it finally clicked: PCA wasn’t just reducing data—it was rotating it to reveal structure that wasn’t obvious in the original dimensions. I paired PCA with clustering algorithms like K-Means, and the improved cluster separation in two-dimensional plots was a breakthrough. It felt like going from a blurry image to one in focus.",
				"This experience taught me that understanding comes from doing, not just reading. The challenge pushed me to move beyond theoretical knowledge and trust the process of iteration and visual feedback—something I now carry into every project."
