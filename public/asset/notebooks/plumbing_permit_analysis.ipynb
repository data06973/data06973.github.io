    "*   We built a Random Forest model that can identify 44% of all failed inspections, which is a significant improvement over random chance given that failures only account for ~8% of the data.\n",
    "*   **Date-related features** (`Issue_Year`, `Issue_Month`, `Issue_DayOfWeek`) were surprisingly important. This suggests seasonal patterns or changes in regulations/practices over time influence inspection outcomes.\n",
    "*   **Permit Sub-Types** were strong predictors. Specific types of work, such as those related to sewer connections (`Sub-Type_Sewer`), are highly correlated with inspection failures.\n",
    "*   The **Community** where the work is performed also plays a role, with some communities appearing more frequently in the top features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "*   **Tune Hyperparameters:** Use techniques like GridSearchCV to find the optimal settings for the Random Forest model to improve recall for the 'Failed' class.\n",
    "*   **Incorporate Contractor Data:** A more complex analysis could involve investigating if specific contractors have different pass/fail rates.\n",
    "*   **Alternative Models:** Experiment with other models suited for imbalanced data, such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) or using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique) to balance the training data."
